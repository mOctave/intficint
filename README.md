# mOctave's INTeractive FICtion INTerpreter
For some reason, I like to make things hard for myself. So, I figured I'd write an interactive fiction interpreter, which I'm calling Sumatra, since it's not Java but Java's what makes it work.

# Building
Although a JAR file is provided and regularly updated, you may want to build the program yourself. To do this, run the commands in `compile-test.sh`, or run it from the command line with the current directory set here and the command `./compile-test.sh`. This will create the JAR file.

# Using
In order to make sure that all the Sumatra library files are available, ensure that `sumatry` directory is a subdirectory of the directory that holds `intficint.jar`. Then, simply run `intficint.jar` and everything should run smoothly.
